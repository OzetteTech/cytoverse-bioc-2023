# The Cytoverse!

The Cytoverse is a collection of opensource R based tools developed by the founders of **Ozette Technologies** which facilitate programmatic analysis of flow cytometry data.

A number of packages make up the Cytoverse. [flowCore](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCore.html), [flowWorkspace](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowWorkspace.html), [openCyto](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/openCyto.html), and [ggcyto](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggcyto.html) make up the core of the Cytoverse. These packages are, by and large, powerful and sufficient to create robost and reproducible analysis workflows for flow cytometry data. Additional available packages such as flowClust, flowStats, CytoQC, or CytoML can further utilized for niche applications including, but not limited to: TBD

# Workshop outlines

## Aim

The aim of this workshop is to empower flow cytometry users and analysts towards reproducible and programmatic analysis.

By the end of this workshop, the attendees will be able to

-   import flow cytometry data,
-   understand the difference between uncompensated, compensated, and transformed data,
-   identify and generate important plots to assess data quality,
-   identify subpopulations by manually or semi-automated gating of markers,
-   generate plots summarizing the expression of markers and abundance of various subpopulations

## Data

For this workshop, we will use subset of a public dataset: [FR-FCM-Z5PC](https://flowrepository.org/public_experiment_representations/5932) that can be found in **flowrepository.org**.
