## Introduction

Flow cytometry data (regardless of the type of instrument used) is generally saved as a **.fcs** file. This file is populated with raw data, fluorescence intensity (for optics based technologies) and abundance (for mass cytrometry), as well as various metadata including: *user id*, *instrument id*, *dynamic range of instrument*, etc. It is important to be able to interact with and manipulate the **.fcs** file as it gives the users/analysts fine grain control!

## Installing/loading required libraries 

In the workshop, all the cytoverse packages are included in the instance you launched on the Bioconductor Workshop Galaxy, and the docker image this uses will remain available in perpetuity.  That said. if you want to to install `cytoverse` packages outside of docker, the standard Bioconductor tooling works:

```{r install_libraries, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("BioManager")
BiocManager::install("flowCore")
BiocManager::install("flowWorkspace")
BiocManager::install("ggcyto")
BiocManager::install("openCyto")
BiocManager::install("flowStats")
```

For the moment, we only need to load flowCore.

```{r load_library_download_cache, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
library("flowCore")
library(CytoverseBioc2023)
cache_workshop_data()
```

## Reading in FCS files

There are 3 approaches to read in **.fcs** file(s) into R:

- Read in individual **.fcs** files as `flowFrame`,
- Read in a set of **.fcs** files as `flowSet`,
- Read in a set of **.fcs** files as `cytoset`,

(Additionally, you can read a workspace generated with another tool, such as flowjo, using the cytoML package.)

A `flowFrame`, `flowSet` are `cytoset` are all data structures that represent the cytometry data.  Some of these have overlapping functionality, and we'll eventually explain when you would prefer one data structure to another.

The function `read.FCS` is used to read in individual files as a `flowFrame` object. 

Normally, you might download a folder with a set of FCS files and interact with that.  For instance,

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_fcs_path.png")
```

For technical reasons, we can't easily distribute the **.fcs** files in this way for this workshop, but instead reference them through a file cache. This cache is essentially a set of folders, however, and we specify which files we want in it with `get_workshop_data`. (If you want to explore it, you can examine it with `BiocFileCache::bfcinfo(CytoverseBioc2023:::.get_cache())`.)

```{r read.FCS, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
ff <- read.FCS(get_workshop_data("data/fcs_data/4000_TNK-CR1.fcs")$rpath)

# a flowFrame object
ff
```

The `flowFrame` object has 3 slots where various data is stored. 

- `exprs(ff)` stores the expression matrix (i.e. the collected data),
- `parameters(ff)` stores information pertaining to channels: channel name, marker description,and data ranges as an AnnotatedDataFrame,
- `keyword(ff)` stores additional information extracted from the **.fcs** file header. The file header follow ISAC guidelines. Visit [here](https://isac-net.org/page/Data-Standards) for more information. 

## Working with `flowFrame`s

A few useful definitions that help us get oriented with the underlying data in the `flowFrame` object.

  - **Channels**: Instrument derived labels of various parameters that were measured. Channels are the column names of the `flowFrame`. Any data generated from the same instrument will have the same (similar) Channel names.
  - **Markers**: User provided labels for various parameters that were measured. 
For example: Channel name: B710-A, Marker name: CD3 (in `ff`). Marker names are set by the users and may not be unique across experiments/users. Not all channels are markers -- some are physical parameters such as the forward scatter or side scatter.  These channels will have their marker names set to `NA`.
  - **Expression**: Measured values. A matrix where every row is an event (frequently a cell) and every column is a channel.
  
Working with a `flowFrame` object is very similar to working with a `dataframe` in R, where a "row" is a cell and a "column" is a channel.  In particular, subsetting with square brackets `ff[i,j]` or `ff$` works as you might hope.

### Examples


```{r channels, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# channels
colnames(ff)

# markernames
markernames(ff)

# expression
exprs(ff)[1:5,1:5]

```

Notice that there is a correspondence between channels, markers, and the expression matrix. i.e. the `names` of the named vector `markernames(ff)` are a subset of the columns of the expression matrix `exprs(ff)` as well as the columns of the `flowFrame`.

```{r correspondance, echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# interested marker: CD4
marker_cd4 <- markernames(ff)[grepl(pattern = "CD4 ", x = markernames(ff))]
marker_cd4

# extract expression of cd4
e_cd4 <- exprs(ff)[,names(marker_cd4)]
head(e_cd4)

# subset flowFrame by column
s_ff <- ff[,names(marker_cd4)]
s_ff

# subset flowFrame by row
s2_ff <- ff[1:100,]
s2_ff
```

Notice that the subset (`<- [`) operation can be applied directly to the `flowFrame` object so that information regarding the file is preserved.

Below, we show examples of how to manipulate the `flowFrame` object:

```{r manipulate_flowFrame, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# create a new markername
new_name <- c("U785-A" = "test")

# old markernames
markernames(s_ff)

# set new markername
markernames(s_ff) <- new_name
markernames(s_ff)

# manipulating expression values
# notice the data range 
s_ff
hist(exprs(s_ff))

# transform
exprs(s_ff) <- exprs(s_ff)/100

# notice the data range after transformation
s_ff
hist(exprs(s_ff))

```


Notice that the data range summary was not updated when we used `<-` to change the underlying expression matrix. A good practice is to use `transform` function to transform the underlying expression matrix. Importantly, `transform` also updates the data range summary. Moreover, `transform` can also be used to add new columns to the `flowFrame`.

### Exercise

1. Why is `length(colnames(ff))` different than `length(markernames(ff))`?
2. How could you make a random downsample of 1000 cells from `ff`?
3. Make a scatter plot of the forward scatter (`FSC-A`) vs side scatter (`SSC-A`) of `ff` using a graphics package of your choice.

Example

*Note*: We will go over `transformations` in a later section.
 
<!-- AM: should we move this ? -->

```{r transform_flowFrame, echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# define the transformation
simple_trans <- function(x)x/100

# create a transformList
# this indicates which columns to transform and what transformation to do
t_list <- flowCore::transformList(from = c("U785-A"),
                                  tfun = simple_trans)

# before transformation
range(s_ff)

# after transformation
s_ff_trans <- flowCore::transform(s_ff,
                                  t_list)
range(s_ff_trans)

# add a new column
s_ff_trans <- flowCore::transform(s_ff,
                                  "New_col" = simple_trans(`U785-A`)
                                  )
s_ff_trans
```

## Reading in a set of FCS files as `flowSet` or `cytoset`

In a biological sense, a single **.fcs** file is not very interesting, since this represents only a single sample.  To draw any conclusions, we'll want replicates.   When there are a set of **.fcs** files they can be loaded into R either as a `flowSet` or a `cytoset`. 

**flowSet/cytoset**: A collection of **.fcs** files, preferably, but not necessarily from the same panel/experiment.

*Note*: The difference between `flowSet` and `cytoset` is the underlying representation of the data. `cytoset` is implemented in the package `flowWorkspace` which we will encounter in more detail later. Additionally, `cytoset` is built upon a collection of `cytoframe`, analogous to `flowFrame`.

Let's start by going over options to create `flowSet`:

<!-- AM: I wonder if we can avoid discussing flowSets all together?-->

```{r flowSet_example, echo=T, message=TRUE}
# steps to create flowSet

# option 1
# load fcs files as a list
fcs_list <- lapply(X = get_workshop_data(path = "data/fcs_data/")$rpath,
                   FUN = read.FCS)

# convert to flowSet
fs <- as(fcs_list,"flowSet")
fs

# option 2 (preferred)
fs <- read.flowSet(files = get_workshop_data(path = "data/fcs_data/")$rpath) # read in directly as a flowSet
fs
```

Options to create a `cytoset`

```{r cytoset_example, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
library(flowWorkspace)
# option 1 (preferred)
cs <- load_cytoset_from_fcs(files = get_workshop_data(path = "data/fcs_data/")$rpath)

# option 2 (convert flowSet to cytoset)
cs <- flowSet_to_cytoset(fs)
cs
```

A flowSet/cytoset also can be indexed with square brackets `fs[i,j]`, however now the row index `i` selects samples (individual FCS files) rather than cells.

<!-- does $  do anything useful to flowSets? -->

Generally, each FCS file replicate has unique metadata properties that can (**and should**) be supplied to the `flowSet` or `cytoset`. These can be added to by using `pData(x) <- data.frame`. The `rownames` of the dataframe must match the `sampleNames` of the `flowSet`.

```{r show_metadata_fs, echo=TRUE,message=TRUE}
# create metadata
metadata <- data.frame(row.names = sampleNames(fs),
                       Treatment = sample(c("Untreated","Treated"),length(fs), replace = TRUE),
                       panel = ifelse(grepl(pattern = "TNK",x = sampleNames(fs)),"T Cell Panel","Myeloid Panel"))

# prior to providing metadata
pData(fs)

# add metadata 
pData(fs) <- metadata

pData(fs)
```

The benefit of having metadata is that we can use many of the sub-setting operations in a metadata specific manner. 

*Note*: Many of the sub-setting operation for `flowFrame` is also applicable for `flowSet` and `cytoset`. Important distinction, however, is that subset operation for `cytoset` will not create a copy of the data and will point to the same set on disk.

This is much more convenient than going back and forth between the full set of files. 

```{r flowset_subset, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# subset by files that have myeloid staining panel
fs_myeloid <- fs[pData(fs)[["panel"]] == "Myeloid Panel"
                 ,]

fs_myeloid
pData(fs_myeloid)
```

Below is an example of `cytoset` sub-setting which also highlights how the operations performed on `cytoset` affects the underlying data.

```{r cytoset_subset, echo=TRUE,message=TRUE}
# demonstrate how cs point to the same underlying data
range(exprs(cs[[1]])[,"B515-A"])

# subset and show prior to transformation
cs_small <- cs[1]
range(exprs(cs_small[[1]])[,"B515-A"])

# create a transformList
trans <- transformList("B515-A",asinh)
# transform
cs_small <- transform(cs_small,trans)

# after transformation
range(exprs(cs_small[[1]])[,"B515-A"])

# whole cs 
range(exprs(cs[[1]])[,"B515-A"])
```

As you see, the transformation was applied to a subset `cs_small` however the original `cs` was also altered highlighting that both objects were pointing to the same data. To perform a **deep copy** we can use `realize_view()`

```{r cytoset_deep_copy, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# look at underlying expression
range(exprs(cs[[2]])[,"B515-A"])

# subset and show prior to transformation
cs_small2 <- realize_view(cs[2])
range(exprs(cs_small2[[1]])[,"B515-A"])

# create a transformList
trans <- transformList("B515-A",asinh)
# transform
cs_small2 <- transform(cs_small2,trans)

# after transformation
range(exprs(cs_small2[[1]])[,"B515-A"])

# whole cs 
range(exprs(cs[[2]])[,"B515-A"])
```

Notice that `cs` is left unchanged. 

## Adding additional **.fcs** files to `flowSet` and `cytoset`

Lastly, we can also add additional **.fcs** files to a `flowSet` or `cytoset` using `rbind2(flowSet1,flowFrame)` or `cs_add_cytoframe`.

```{r add_more_fcs, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# add to flowSet
fs_small <- fs[1]
fs_small

# add a flowFrame to a flowSet
fs_small <- rbind2(fs_small, fs[[2]]) # fs[[2]] results in a flowFrame
fs_small

# add a flowSet to a flowSet
fs_small <- rbind2(fs_small, fs[3]) # fs[3] results in a flowSet
fs_small

# add to cytoset
cs_small <- realize_view(cs[1]) # cs[1] subsets cs into a cytoset while realize_view leads to a deep_copy into a new cytoset
cs_small

# no need to point to cs_small
cs_add_cytoframe(cs = cs_small, sn = "Sample Name", cf = cs[[3]]) # cs[[3]] results in a cytoframe
cs_small
```

## Saving your data

Saving your data is easy.

```{r save_fcs,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# save flowFrame
write.FCS(ff,"mynewfile.fcs")

# save flowSet
write.flowSet(fs,outdir = "my/data/goes/here",filename = "myflowset")

# save cytoset
save_cytoset(cs, path = "my/data/goes/here")
```


## Conclusion

We went through multiple ways to import, interact with, and manipulate **.fcs** files using the `cytoverse` tools. It is important to note additional functionality, *which we will not going to go over at this workshop for the sake of time*, for further manipulation and even creation of **.fcs** files exist with the `cytoverse`. We encourage you to explore them further at your leisure by calling `browseVignettes("packagename")`.
