# Background

In this section, we aim to clarify the concept of Spillover, and the use of spillover/compensation matrices to correct for this. The last part of this section will deal with various transformations of the underlying expression data.

## Spillover

[CLARIFY THIS FURTHER] Flow cytometers (optics based: spectral or non-spectral) collect fluorescent signal from a cell as result of a laser excitation. Briefly, cell type C has been labelled with a marker M that is conjugated to a fluorophore (F). F has the property that it is excitation maxima at certain wavelength (W) resulting in fluoroscence. While the fluoresence has a emmision maxima, the emission profile of F can span many nanometers. The cytometer has a dedicated detector (channel) A to detect peak emission of F. However, due to the spread of the emission of F, some signal from F is also "spilled" onto detector B, a detector for a different fluorophore.

The image below provides a concrete example.

![Excitation/Emission spectra for FITC. Taken from Bio-Rad. A is the dedicated detector for FITC. B is a secondary detector where FITC signal spills over.](https://static.bio-rad-antibodies.com/2016/flow-cytometry/fig-9-spectral-profiles.png)

The "spillover" of signal onto secondary detector(s) is additive and can be easily recovered (more on this below).

Raw Signal in B = Signal from FITC (spillover) + Signal for a dedicated fluorophore.

Signal recovery (Compensation) requires a set of controls be present to calculate the spillover. These controls are called **Single Colour Controls** and are often acquired prior to sample acquisition. The purpose of the single colour control is to estimate the amount of spillover of emission from fluorophore F onto non-primary detectors (detector B in the image above).

[TO ADD INFORMATION ABOUT SPECTRAL] Note: ABOUT Spectral instruments are set up slightly differently...

## Importance of spillover correction

Let's visualize the data to highlight the main issues related to spillover. We will make use of the `ggcyto` library from the `cytoverse` for this. We will dive into more details on the usage of `ggcyto` in a later section.

```{r viz_uncompensated_data, echo=FALSE, eval=T, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}

# read file
ff <- read.FCS(get_workshop_data("4000_BDC-CR1.fcs")$rpath)[,-32]

# define transformation
trans <- transformList(from = names(markernames(ff)),
                       tfun = (function(x)asinh(x/500))) # user definition
# transform
ff_trans <- transform(ff,trans)

# plot
uncompensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_trans, # flowFrame, flowSet, cytoframe, cytoset, GatingSet, or GatingHierarchy can be used as data source
                                  aes(x = "CD3", y = "CD5"))+ # automatic matching of markernames
                          geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                          theme_bw()+
                          labs(title = "Uncompensated data"))

# compensate
ff_comp <- compensate(ff, spillover(ff)[[3]])
# transform
ff_comp <- transform(ff_comp,trans)

# plot
compensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_comp, 
                                aes(x = "CD3", y = "CD5"))+
                        geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                        theme_bw()+
                        labs(title = "Compensated data")+
                        axis_x_inverse_trans()) # axis is transformed instead of data

gridExtra::grid.arrange(uncompensated,
                        compensated,
                        nrow = 1, 
                        top = "1. Difficulty resolving the correct populations")

```

Another example:

```{r uncompensated_data_issue,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE, fig.width=10}

uncompensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_trans, 
                                  aes(x = "SSC-A", y = "Live"))+
                                  geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                                  theme_bw()+
                                  labs(title = "Uncompensated data"))

compensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_comp, 
                                aes(x = "SSC-A", y = "Live"))+
                                geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                                theme_bw()+
                                labs(title = "Compensated data"))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(uncompensated, 
                        compensated, 
                        nrow = 1, 
                        top = "2. Wrong conclusions")

```

In example 1,the plot first plot shows the uncompensated data. In this example, the 2 fluorophores: PE-Cy5 and PE-Cy5.5 are spilling onto each other, making the data not resolvable. However, after correcting for spillover, we see that the data can be resolved (2nd plot).

In example 2, we see a population of events that are positive of marker: Live Dead UV Blue. Generally, these events are discarded as this marker is used to identify dead cells. However, in correctly compensated data, we see that this population does not exist!

## Where to find your spillover matrix?

In many cases, the spillover matrix (which is used to correct the spillover) is attached to the FCS files within `$SPILLOVER`,`SPILL`,or `SPILL` keywords. In `cytoverse`, we can check for the presence of by using the function `spillover(ff)`.

Example:

```{r show_spill, echo=T, message=TRUE}
# show spillover
spillover(ff)
```

We notice a few important details. - `spillover(ff)` returns all 3 keywords, even if some do not contain a matrix - It is not necessary that all 3 keywords have a matrix - spillover matrix is square. This is because the user will run 1 single colour control for each channel/marker they intend to acquire. In this example its 28 x 28

The columns of the spillover matrix are the detectors while the rows are contribution from each fluorophore. Visualizing it as a heatmap is sometimes more helpful

```{r explain_spillover, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
# extract spillover
s.mat <- spillover(ff)[[3]]
rownames(s.mat) <- markernames(ff)

pheatmap::pheatmap(mat = s.mat,
                   cluster_rows = F,
                   cluster_cols = F,
                   color = colorRampPalette(c("black","orange","cyan","magenta"))(100),
                   display_numbers = T,
                   number_format = "%.2f",
                   legend = FALSE,
                   number_color = "white")
```

Looking at the figure, column 2: B610-A has high spillover from flurophore: PE-Dazzle594 and PE.

In fact, when we look at the emission spectrum of the 2 dyes we see that this issue is apparent:
