# Background

In this section, we aim to clarify the concept of Spillover, and the use of `spillover/compensation` matrices to correct for this. The last part of this section will deal with various transformations of the underlying expression data.

## Spillover

Flow cytometers (optics based: spectral or non-spectral) collect fluorescent signal from a cell as result of a laser excitation. Briefly, cell type **C** has been labelled with a marker **M** that is conjugated to a fluorophore (**F**). **F** has excitation maxima at certain wavelength (**W**) resulting in fluorescence. While the fluorescence has a emission maxima, the emission profile of **F** can span many nanometers. The cytometer has a dedicated detector (channel) **A** to detect peak emission of **F**. However, due to the spread of the emission of **F**, some signal from **F** is also "spilled" onto detector **B**, a detector for a different fluorophore.

The image below provides a concrete example.

![Excitation/Emission spectra for FITC. Taken from Bio-Rad. A is the dedicated detector for FITC. B is a secondary detector where FITC signal spills over.](https://static.bio-rad-antibodies.com/2016/flow-cytometry/fig-9-spectral-profiles.png)

The "spillover" of signal onto secondary detector(s) is **additive** and can be easily recovered (more on this below).

Raw Signal in $B = \text{Signal from FITC (spillover)} + \text{Signal for a dedicated fluorophore}.$

Signal recovery (compensation) requires a set of controls be present to calculate the spillover. These controls are called **Single Colour Controls** and are acquired prior to sample acquisition. The purpose of the single colour control is to estimate the amount of spillover of emission from fluorophore **F** onto non-primary detectors (detector **B** in the image above).

[TO ADD INFORMATION ABOUT SPECTRAL] Note: ABOUT Spectral instruments are set up slightly differently...

## Importance of spillover correction

Let's visualize the data to highlight the main issues related to spillover. We will make use of the `ggcyto` library from the `cytoverse` for this. We will dive into more details on the usage of `ggcyto` in a later section.

```{r viz_uncompensated_data, echo=FALSE, eval=T, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}
# read file
ff <- read.FCS(get_workshop_data("4000_BDC-CR1.fcs")$rpath)[,-32]

# define transformation
trans <- transformList(from = names(markernames(ff)),
                       tfun = (function(x)asinh(x/500))) # user definition
# transform
ff_trans <- transform(ff,trans)

# plot
uncompensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_trans, # flowFrame, flowSet, cytoframe, cytoset, GatingSet, or GatingHierarchy can be used as data source
                                  aes(x = "CD3", y = "CD5"))+ # automatic matching of markernames
                          geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                          theme_bw()+
                          labs(title = "Uncompensated data"))

# compensate
ff_comp <- compensate(ff, spillover(ff)[[3]])
# transform
ff_comp <- transform(ff_comp,trans)

# plot
compensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_comp, 
                                aes(x = "CD3", y = "CD5"))+
                        geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                        theme_bw()+
                        labs(title = "Compensated data")+
                        axis_x_inverse_trans()) # axis is transformed instead of data

gridExtra::grid.arrange(uncompensated,
                        compensated,
                        nrow = 1, 
                        top = "1. Difficulty resolving the correct populations")


uncompensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_trans, 
                                  aes(x = "SSC-A", y = "Live"))+
                                  geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                                  theme_bw()+
                                  labs(title = "Uncompensated data"))

compensated <- as.ggplot(ggcyto(ff_comp, 
                                aes(x = "SSC-A", y = "Live"))+
                                geom_hex(bins = 128)+
                                theme_bw()+
                                labs(title = "Compensated data"))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(uncompensated, 
                        compensated, 
                        nrow = 1, 
                        top = "2. Wrong conclusions")

```

In example 1, the 2 fluorophores: PE-Cy5 and PE-Cy5.5 are spilling onto each other, making the data not resolvable. However, after correcting for spillover, we see that the data can be resolved (2nd plot).

In example 2, we see a population of events that are positive of marker: **Live Dead UV Blue**. Generally, these events are discarded as this marker is used to identify dead cells. However, in correctly compensated data, we see that this population does not exist!

*Note:* The above conclusion is only regarding the data we are working with.

## Where to find the spillover matrix?

In many cases, the spillover matrix (which is used to correct the spillover) is attached to the **.fcs** files within `$SPILLOVER`,`SPILL`,or `SPILL` keywords. In `cytoverse`, we can check for the presence of by using the function `spillover(ff)`.

```{r show_spill, echo=T, message=TRUE}
# show spillover
spillover(ff)
```

We notice a few important details. 
  - `spillover(ff)` returns all 3 keywords, even if some do not contain a matrix 
  - It is not necessary that all 3 keywords have a matrix 
  - spillover matrix is square. This is because the user will run 1 single colour control for each channel/marker they intend to acquire. In this example its 28 x 28

The columns of the spillover matrix are the **detectors** while the rows are contribution from each **fluorophore**. Visualizing it as a heatmap is sometimes more helpful

```{r explain_spillover, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
# extract spillover
s.mat <- spillover(ff)[[3]]
rownames(s.mat) <- markernames(ff)

pheatmap::pheatmap(mat = s.mat,
                   cluster_rows = F,
                   cluster_cols = F,
                   color = colorRampPalette(c("black","orange","cyan","magenta"))(100),
                   display_numbers = T,
                   number_format = "%.2f",
                   legend = FALSE,
                   number_color = "white")
```

Looking at the figure, column 2: B610-A has high spillover from flurophore: PE-Dazzle594 and PE.

In fact, when we look at the emission spectrum of the 2 dyes we see that this issue is apparent:

![Spectra from PE and BB630P2.](images/spectrumChart.png)The image was created at <https://www.bdbiosciences.com/en-ca/resources/bd-spectrum-viewer> using the BD spectrum viewer tool.

### Calculating spillover from single colour controls

Another way to calculate spillover is by using a set of single colour controls. This is generally a part of experiment/instrument set up before acquisition begins.

Generally, there ought to be the same number of single colour controls as the number of markers being assessed + 1 unstained to estimate the background auto-fluorescence of cells.

The dataset that we are primarily working with (i.e. [FR-FCM-Z5PC](https://flowrepository.org/public_experiment_representations/5932)) did not come with a set of control files to generate the spillover matrix. So for demonstration purposes, we will use single colour controls from a different dataset [FR-FCM-ZZ36](https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZ36). The data was published in this [manuscript](10.1002/cyto.a.22278).

```{r generating_spillover_with_controls, echo=TRUE, eval =TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height=10}
library(dplyr)

data_files <- get_workshop_data("FlowRepository_FR-FCM-ZZ36_files/")

# load csv identifying the mapping of control files
control_files <- dplyr::filter(data_files, 
                               grepl(x = rname, 
                                     pattern = "control_files.csv")) %>% # csv is saved as control files
                 dplyr::pull(rpath) %>% 
                 read.csv(row.names = 1) %>% 
                 mutate(filename = file.path("data",
                                             "FlowRepository_FR-FCM-ZZ36_files",
                                             .[["filename"]])) # folder structure

# get file locations
control_files <- filter(data_files,
                        rname %in% control_files[["filename"]]) %>% 
                 select(rname,rpath) %>% 
                 left_join(x = control_files,
                            y = .,
                            by = c("filename" = "rname"))

# load the set of compensation files
comp_frames <- lapply(control_files[["rpath"]], read.FCS) # example of using lapply to read in FCS files into a list
names(comp_frames) <- control_files[["channel"]]

# convert to flowSet
comp_fs <- as(comp_frames,"flowSet")


# quick visualization of what the control files contain
all_control_percp <- ggcyto::as.ggplot(ggcyto(comp_fs,
                                      aes(x = "FSC-A", y = "PerCP-Cy5-5-A"))+
                                      geom_hex(bins = 256)+
                                      theme_bw()+
                                      scale_y_flowCore_fasinh(b = 1/150)+
                                      labs(title = "Detection of PerCP-Cy5-5 in all control samples "))
all_control_percp
```

Notice that the signal recieved in the channel PerCP-Cy5-5-A is highest for PerCP Cy5.5. At the same time, other fluorophores are also spilling over into this channel, for instance PE.

Now, we calculate the spillover matrix using the set of controls. We will use `spillover` function from `flowStats` package within the `cytoverse`.

```{r generating_spillover_with_controls_calculate, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# calculate spillover
## using spillover from flowStats
spill <- flowStats::spillover(comp_fs,
                   unstained = "Unstained", # indicate how the unstained file is named in flowset
                   patt = "-A", # indicate which parameter should be considered 
                   fsc = "FSC-A",
                   ssc = "SSC-A",
                   stain_match = "regexpr",
                   useNormFilt = TRUE)
```

Now, let's visualize the spill matrix that we calculated.

[NOTE: This needs to be corrected in the flowStats package. Normalization is with respect to the max value and not with respect to the intended channel].

```{r viz_calculated_spill, eval=T, echo=FALSE}
pheatmap::pheatmap(mat = spill,
                   cluster_rows = F,
                   cluster_cols = F,
                   color = colorRampPalette(c("black","orange","cyan","magenta"))(100),
                   display_numbers = T, 
                   legend = FALSE,
                   number_color = "white",
                   number_format = "%.3f")
```

*Note: "Close or related fluorophores will have some degree of overlap"*

Lastly, we check the effect of *compensating* these files.

[NOTE: COMPENSATION MATRIX IS NOT CORRECT. THIS IS BECAUSE `spillover` in `flowStats` NORMALIZES TO MAX OF ROW INSTEAD OF MAX OF CHANNEL]

```{r show_comp_effect, echo=T, eval=TRUE}
# read in FCS
luca_fcs_file <- dplyr::filter(data_files, grepl(x = rname,
                                                pattern = "pbmc_luca.fcs")) %>% 
                 pull(rpath)

ff <- read.FCS(luca_fcs_file)
trans <- flowCore::transformList(from = setdiff(sampleNames(comp_fs),"Unstained"),
                                 tfun = flowCore::arcsinhTransform(b = 1/150)
                                 )
ff_trans <- transform(ff,trans) # transformation defined above

# plot pre-compensation
pre_compensation <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff_trans,          # autoplot can be used to generate plots rapidly
                                       x = "PE-Cy5-5-A", 
                                       y = "PE-Cy5-A", 
                                       bins = 256)+
                                labs(title = "Uncompensated data"))

# compensate
ff_comp <- compensate(ff,spill)
ff_comp <- transform(ff_comp,trans)

# plot post-compensation
post_compensation <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff_comp,
                                       x = "PE-Cy5-5-A", 
                                       y = "PE-Cy5-A", 
                                       bins = 256)+
                                 labs(title = "Compensated data"))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(pre_compensation, 
                        post_compensation, 
                        nrow = 1)
```

## Transformation and visualization

Cytometry data tends to have a very high dynamic range. For example: the range of values in `PE-Cy5-5-A` channel in the FCS we have been working with is `-111 2621543`. The difference between cells that do not express a marker of interest and a cell that expresses variable level of marker could be order of magnitude difference. In such a scenario, transformation of the data can aid in better visualization and representation of the biological phenomena.

There are multiple approaches to transform the data in `cytoverse`. We will identify a few common ones as well as demonstrate how to create new transformations.

First, let's visualize why transformation is necessary. We go back to working with data from [FR-FCM-Z5PC](https://flowrepository.org/public_experiment_representations/5932).

```{r demo_transformations, echo=FALSE, eval=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# read fcs
demo_fcs <- get_workshop_data("fcs_data/") %>% 
            dplyr::filter(grepl(x = rname,
                                pattern = "4000_BDC-CR1")) %>% 
            pull(rpath)
ff <- read.FCS(demo_fcs)
ff <- compensate(ff, spillover(ff)[[3]])

no_transform <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff,
         x = "CD14",
         y = "HLA-DR",
         bins = 256)+
  labs(title = "No transformation applied"))

biexp <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff,
         x = "CD14",
         y = "HLA-DR",
         bins = 256)+
  scale_x_flowjo_biexp()+
  scale_y_flowjo_biexp()+
  labs(title = "Biexponential"))

log_trans <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff,
         x = "CD14",
         y = "HLA-DR",
         bins = 256)+
  scale_x_continuous(trans = flowWorkspace::flowjo_log_trans())+
  scale_y_continuous(trans = flowWorkspace::flowjo_log_trans())+
  labs(title = "Log"))

asinh_t <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff,
         x = "CD14",
         y = "HLA-DR",
         bins = 256)+
  scale_x_flowjo_fasinh()+
  scale_y_flowCore_fasinh()+
  labs(title = "inverse hyperbolic sine"))

logicle <- as.ggplot(autoplot(ff,
         x = "CD14",
         y = "HLA-DR",
         bins = 256)+
  scale_x_logicle()+
  scale_y_logicle()+
  labs(title = "Logicle"))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(no_transform,
                        biexp, 
                        log_trans,
                        asinh_t, 
                        logicle, 
                        nrow = 2,
                        bottom = "Generic transformations of compensated data")
```

As we see, the variety of transformations aids in visualization and interpretation of the data.

### Steps to transform data

The `cytoverse` libraries: `flowWorkspace` and `flowCore` have a multiple commonly used transformations (some are shown above) as well, one can also create a custom transformation if required.

Let's first use a built in transformation.

```{r how_to_transform_builtin, echo=T, eval=T, message=F}
# transforming using cytoverse functions
# define a transformation
asinh_trans <- flowWorkspace::asinh_Gml2()

# create a transformList that indicates which parameters to transform
my_trans_list <- flowCore::transformList(from = names(markernames(ff)),
                                         tfun = asinh_trans)


# transform 
ff_transformed <- flowCore::transform(ff, my_trans_list)

# visualize
ff_comp <- as.ggplot(
  autoplot(ff,
           x = "CD14", 
           y = "HLA-DR",
           bins = 256)
)

ff_comp_transformed <- as.ggplot(
  autoplot(ff_transformed,
           x = "CD14",
           y = "HLA-DR",
           bins = 256)
)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(ff_comp, ff_comp_transformed, nrow = 1)

```

Another option is to use a user defined transformation.

```{r user_defined_transformation,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# define a transformation
my_trans <- function(x){
  return(sqrt(abs(x)))
}

# create a transformList
my_trans_list <- flowCore::transformList(from = names(markernames(ff)), 
                                         tfun = my_trans)

# transform
ff_transformed <- transform(ff, my_trans_list)

# visualize
ff_comp_transformed <- as.ggplot(
  autoplot(ff_transformed,
           x = "CD14",
           y = "HLA-DR",
           bins = 256)
)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(ff_comp, ff_comp_transformed, nrow = 1)

```

We can also transform a set of FCS files (`flowSet`)

```{r transform_flowset, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# read in a flowSet
fcs_files <- get_workshop_data("fcs_data/") %>% 
                 dplyr::filter(grepl(x = rname,
                                     pattern = "BDC-CR1")) %>% 
                 pull(rpath)
fs <- flowCore::read.flowSet(files = fcs_files) # read in a set of FCS files as flowSet

# compensate
fs <- fsApply(fs, function(x){ # fsApply will return a the same object as input
              spill = spillover(x)[[3]]
              compensate(x,spillover = spill)
            })

# using asinh_trans defined previously
my_trans_list <- flowCore::transformList(from = names(markernames(ff)),
                                         tfun = asinh_trans)
# using the same approach as shown previously
fs_transformed <- transform(fs, my_trans_list)

# visualize
fs_raw <- as.ggplot(autoplot(fs, # autoplot being used to plot a flowSet
                   x = "CD14",
                   y = "HLA-DR",
                   bins = 256)+
                   labs(title = "Untransformed flowSet"))

fs_trans <- as.ggplot(autoplot(fs_transformed,
                     x = "CD14",
                     y = "HLA-DR",
                     bins = 256)+
                     labs(title = "Transformed flowSet"))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(fs_raw, fs_trans, nrow = 1)
```

Similarly, we also transform a `cytoset`.

```{r trans_cytoset, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# load a cytoset from fcs files
cs <- flowWorkspace::load_cytoset_from_fcs(files = fcs_files)

# compensate
spill <- spillover(cs[[1]])[[3]]
cs <- compensate(cs, spill)

# transform: this will transform the underlying data 
transform(cs,my_trans_list)
```

## Conclusion

In this section we have described the concept of **spillover** and how to use the `spillover` matrix to correct for this phenomenon. As well, we described an approach to generate the `spillover` matrix when it is has not be pre-populated in the **.fcs** files. 
We also highlighted several built-in transformations in `cytoverse` as well as approaches to generate new user defined transformations. Data transformation is topic that can require several workshops in itself. As such, we encourage users/analyst to follow best and appropriate practices. A highly informative reading is the following: [An updated guide for the perplexed: cytometry in the high-dimensional era](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34489590/).
